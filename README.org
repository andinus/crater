Crater is a media gallery.

* History

Initially I planned to make a simple gallery to share pictures with
friends. The idea was to share my pictures, writings with friends for a
specific trip.

I released ~v0.1.0~ that does achieve this. Specific directories can be
shared easily along with writings. It displays pictures in pretty
masonry layout.

I want to expand this to make a media gallery that I can use to view my
pictures/videos. And I also want to be able to create album out of them
and share it with my friends.
